# Unit-Converter
simple Unit converter with GUI with python 

INTRODUCTION
Unit conversion is a multi-step process that involves multiplication or division by a numerical factor, selection of the correct number of significant digits, and rounding including a rounding procedure for technical documents, specifications, and other applications such packaged goods in the commercial marketplace and temperature.
Unit conversion is a process with multiple steps that involves multiplication or division by a numerical factor or, particularly a conversion factor. The process may also require selection of the correct number of significant digits, and rounding. Different units of conversion are used to measure different parameters.


TECHNOLOGY USED

•	PYTHON 3.10.1
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.


MODULE

Dimensional analysis is a technique used to convert measurements. 
s three dimensions (e.g., length, width, and height). Converting between measurement units is a very important skill when working within and between measurement systems.
A conversion ratio (or unit factor) always equals one (1), where the numerator and the denominator have the same value expressed in different units.
 numerator represents the parts out of the whole or how much you have. denominator represents the total number of parts of the whole. In this example of the common fraction ¾, 3 is the numerator and 4 is the denominator. Performing the math calculation (3 divided by 4) transforms the number into a decimal fraction, 0.75.


ALGORITHM & FLOW CHART

Unit Conversion Process
This process uses the fact that any number or expression can be multiplied by "one" without changing its value. This allows the conversion of units by multiplying the initial measurement by one (or more) forms of the number 1. While the multiplication by 1 does not change the value of the measurement, it does change the measurement units.
It’s very easy to systematically apply unit conversion process to solve conversions within or between measurement systems. It may be necessary to multiply by more than one conversion ratio in more complex conversions. Use these steps to construct a unit conversion problem so one (or more) of the units cancel until only the desired unit remains:
Step 1. Identify the unit you have. These are the Starting Units.
Step 2. Identify the unit you want. These are the Desired Units.
Step 3. Identify appropriate unit conversion factor(s). These are the Linking (or Ratio) Unit(s). Use EXACT conversion factors whenever available.
Step 4. Cancel units and perform the math calculations (e.g., multiply, divide). Repeat the calculation (double check).
Step 5. Evaluate the result. 


ADVANTAGES

•	Advantages of a unit converter
•	We don't waste time in calculating unit conversion because if we calculate by ourselves, the procedure will be very complicated because we need to find units to divide and raise power.
•	Make unit conversion values stable and accurate because if we convert the units ourselves, we may be wrong.
•	We don't have to pay for the cost of the calculation.
•	The quick unit conversion makes us more convenient.
•	It does not allow us to calculate the unit multiple times because the unit we select to convert the result of this unit converter program will appear alongside all other units.
•	This Convert Unit program can let us know Using the most recent user data, we determined which units and days to calculate.
•	This enables us to determine who has used this program and whether the number of units and units are the same. We are not going to waste time recalculating.


CONCLUSION

We conclude that Unit Converter is useful in  case of using different unit for calculation at a time. And The conclusion should include what you’ve learned from working and researching the paper. We learnd about how python is useful, for develop-pment, how different modules and predefined as well as userdefined function is declared in py also learn how script mode and file mode is inatialised.
